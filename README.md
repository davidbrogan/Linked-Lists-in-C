# Linked-Lists-in-C
This is a working example of how linked lists are used in the C Programming langauge.
Linked lists are very useful and essential when one doesn't the know the amount of data they are reading im. 
It ensures a structure or array is never too small, and not hold all the data as well as not oo big, and not wasting memory.
Of course in this example, one would wonder why linked lists are necessary but for huge files they are essential.
